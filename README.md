# Car Obstacle Game

A simple 2D console game written in C using graphics.h. The game simulates a red car driving along a road and avoiding blue obstacles falling from the top of the screen. It is designed as a beginner-friendly graphics project to demonstrate basic animation, collision detection, scoring, and sound in C programming.

## How to Play

- Use the left (←) and right (→) arrow keys to move the red car left or right within the road boundaries.
- Avoid hitting the blue obstacles falling from the top of the screen.
- Each time you successfully avoid an obstacle, your score increases.
- The speed of the obstacles increases every 5 points to make the game more challenging.
- The game ends when a collision happens, and your final score is displayed.
- Sound effects are triggered when scoring and on collision.

## Features

- Simple 2D graphics with graphics.h
- Real-time keyboard input with conio.h
- Collision detection between car and obstacles
- Score counter and speed progression logic
- Sound feedback using dos.h
- Game Over screen with final score

## Technologies Used

- C Language
- graphics.h (Turbo C/C++ or compatible DOSBox setup)
- conio.h, dos.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h

## Setup Instructions

> Note: This project is designed to run in Turbo C++ or a DOSBox environment that supports graphics.h.

1. Open the code in Turbo C++ or compatible compiler.
2. Make sure the graphics.h and BGI folder are properly configured.
3. Compile and run the game.
